# Fantasy Football Auction Platform

Making this because we have nothing better than Google Forms and Sheets for auctioning players.

### What can I do with it?
- League admin can input players to be auctioned each week.
- Managers can bid on players each week.
- Anyone can look at auction history from current and past seasons.
  - View by Manager
  - View by Player

### What's it made of?
- Frontend in React
- Backend in Rust
- a database
