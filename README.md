# Fantasy Football Auction Platform

Making this because we have nothing better than Google Forms and Sheets for auctioning players.

### What can I do with it?
- League admin can input players to be auctioned each week.
- Managers can bid on players each week.
- Anyone can look at auction history.
  - View by Manager
  - View by Player

### How is this designed?
- Frontend in React (because I want to learn it).
- Backend in Rust (because it's cool).
- Postgres database (until I find something more interesting).
